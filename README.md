# StarResonanceACTPlugin

**WIP**

Most code is thankfully ported from [StarResonanceDamageCounter](https://github.com/dmlgzs/StarResonanceDamageCounter).

## Problems

- Packet Lost!! (Maybe caused by Malus connecting with UDP?)
- Zstd packet seems not be parsed correctly.
- ACT Encounter init / manage.
